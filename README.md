ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mats van Splunter

I'm a developer in training at Bit Academy with a passion for backend development and a growing interest in full-stack and DevOps.

ðŸ’» Iâ€™ve worked with technologies like:

    PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS

    Currently learning Python

    Experience with Docker for deployment

ðŸ”§ Projects Iâ€™ve worked on include:

    Holding the Drones: A full-stack matching platform for drone operators and clients

    No Waste Decoration: A website focused on promoting sustainability and recycling

ðŸ§  What drives me is learning by doing â€” I like solving problems, building useful tools, and getting better every day.
