ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mats van Splunter

I'm a developer in training at Bit Academy with a passion for backend development.

ðŸ’» Iâ€™ve worked with technologies like:

    PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS

    Currently learning Python

    Experience with Docker for deployment

ðŸ”§ Projects Iâ€™ve worked on include:

    Holding the Drones â€“ A full-stack matching platform for drone operators and clients

    No Waste Decoration â€“ A website focused on promoting sustainability and recycling

ðŸ§  I enjoy learning by doing â€” solving problems, building useful tools, and improving every day.

ðŸŽ® In my free time, I like playing games with my family and friends, or doing sports like boxing, karting, and football with a friend.
